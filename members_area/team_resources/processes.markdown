These processes are meant to provide team ideas for deeper exploration into Men’s Work. Because of the complex nature of men’s work, here are some tools to use in your team’s exploration to empower meaningful transformation.   It is strongly advisable before attempting to embark on a process that your team leadership mentions your intentions to your team Hero.   Your team Hero is a good resource and may be aware of best practices, or other adaptations to a process that other teams have utilized throughout the years in finding out what works for their own unique team.  Be sure to check here often as new processes are posted regularly!

The posted processes are a collection of men's work for several authors.  In keeping with the original thoughts of the author, no changes other than a standard template format and grammatical changes have been made to the processes.
