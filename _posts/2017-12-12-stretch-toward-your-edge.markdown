Men, here is the handout, "Own Momentum: Stretch Toward Your Edge" that I distributed at the January 2017 GM.  It was powerful to hear how men are stretching toward their edges.  Let's work together to continue to stretch toward and stay at our growing edges.

Some questions to consider, discuss with your team, or talk about on Discourse:

1. What are you working on right now?  
2. Is there an area of your life in which you feel called to stretch or make a move?
2. Do you see any of these stages in your own life?  Where do you want to Own Momentum in your life?
3. How can you stretch toward your edge in 2017?
