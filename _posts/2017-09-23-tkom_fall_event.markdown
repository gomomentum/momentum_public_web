# TKOm -- a Powerful Process of Discovery

The 2017 Fall Event's focus was deeper self-knowledge, and the TKOm weekend will deliver a four-step process to increasing your personal power, owning our life, and specifically, being strong and grounded to avoid emotional triggers that life puts in our path. TKOm is a powerful process that can help us _Own Momentum_ in our lives.  


TKOm stands for:

* **T:** Tell it like it is

* **K:** Know your emotions

* **O:** Own your motivators

* **M:** Man up, ask for what you want

* * * 

Here is an example:

* **T:** Steve and a team of men led 60 participants on a Fall Event from 9/8 to 9/10 at Camp Cutter.  The participants were taught a four-step process called T-K-O-M.  

* **K:** I feel empowered, optimistic, and enthusiastic

* **O:** I see the TKOm process as directly connecting to our [values](https://discourse.gomomentum.org/t/momentums-values/1407/8) as a community.

* **M**: I want to ask the community to share stories, experiences, and questions so that we can continue to Own Momentum toward being the men that we've always wanted to be.
