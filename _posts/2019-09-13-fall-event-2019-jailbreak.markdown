The 2019 Momentum Fall Event theme is **JAILBREAK!** This year, we'll be at Camp Campbell, a YMCA facility near Boulder Creek. A bunch of YMCA men will join us, giving us a valuable opportunity to introduce them to Momentum. We will be providing CONTENT for these men. In return, the YMCA is handling all FOOD and KITCHEN CLEANUP for the entire weekend!

Don't even look for your tent. The entire camp is outfitted with cabins for everyone! Beds, blankets, and pillows are provided. Each bunk has electric power. Each cabin has its own indoor toilets and showers. Travel time from Silicon Valley to the camp is only around an hour!

In addition to the amazing growth sessions we're planning, the facility is equipped with a ton of fun things to do during the weekend. Swimming pool, high ropes course, climbing wall, archery range, hiking trails, and more!
