# Truly Rebuilding Together

The men of Momentum showed up in force this weekend, bringing about significant impact by their collective efforts. Thirty Momentum men volunteered their time, and when combined with friends and family, we had nearly 80 volunteers over the four days of the project.

The reactions of the shelter staff and residents returning late on Sunday night were ecstatic, blown away by the way we transformed their space and very grateful.
