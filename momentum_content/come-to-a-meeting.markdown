At its core face-to-face encounters are central to the Momentum experience. We'd love to have you come out and see if Momentum is for you. 

Our monthly meeting is the Second Saturday of every month at [Bramhall Park in San Jose](https://www.meetup.com/GoMomentum/). The meeting starts promptly at 10 AM, goes till 12 noon, and always includes an amazing breakfast. Look for a group of about 50 men.
