Charter
=======

Rules and Decisions
-------------------

The rules and standards of the men's organization Momentum are contained in this written Charter.

Proposed changes to the Charter must be presented via email to members at least 14 days prior to a General Meeting and ratified by two-thirds of the members who vote at the meeting. Abstentions do not count. There are no proxy votes.

All decisions not otherwise prescribed in the Charter are made by the Chief.

Membership
----------

Members must be men, 18 years of age or older, who have met the membership requirements. Members are encouraged to be on teams but it is not required. A team can be comprised of both members and non-members; that is, the whole team does not need to be in Momentum. Dues are established by the Chief and must be paid in full to maintain membership.

Leadership
----------

Momentum is led by a Chief, or Co-Chiefs (herein "Chief"). There is no fixed term for Chiefs. 

#### Leadership succession
When a Chief announces that he plans to step down or the position is vacated, the former Chiefs form a Nominating Committee, which manages the nomination and election processes. The Committee solicits nominations from members; vets the nominees in the Primal tradition, in a spirit of truth and ruthless compassion; and presents a slate with one or more candidates to the membership at least one week prior to a General Meeting, at which the Committee manages an election process, which includes discussion and opportunities to revise the slate. A “candidate” on the slate may be more than one man (i.e., co- chiefs). A candidate becomes Chief upon receiving more than 50% of votes cast. Only members can vote and only in-person (there are no proxy votes); abstentions do not count.

#### Leadership completion
Chiefs serve until they resign or are removed by a vote of "no-confidence." Any group of five or more members may bring a vote of no-confidence at any time by notifying the members via email at least 14 days prior to the General Meeting at which the vote will be held. A verdict of no confidence is upheld by a majority vote of the members at the General Meeting.

Completing Chiefs are held in a position of honor.

Continuity
----------

Momentum will have a Legacy Council, whose purpose is:
1. To advise the Chief and informally hold him accountable to his vision and to his duties under this Charter and according to the legacy of Momentum.
2. To maintain records of the institutional infrastructure of Momentum such as financial records and procedures; account passwords; insurance, tax and other essential documentation; event technology and traditions.
3. To ensure continuity of core functions that span chiefdoms..
4. If the Chief’s position is vacated, appoint an interim Chief to serve until a new Chief is chosen.

The Legacy Council is made up of four local Momentum members with at least three years tenure.
1. Legacy Council members are appointed by the Chief.
2. No more than two Legacy Council members can be members of the same Momentum team.
3. Each Legacy Council member will serve a term of two years.
4. The terms are staggered by six months. Legacy Council members may not serve consecutive terms. After a six-month period of not serving, they may be appointed to an additional term. When a Legacy Council member resigns, the term of his replacement will be two years plus the length of time remaining on the resigning Legacy Council member’s term.

Meetings and Activities
-----------------------

There will be a monthly General Meeting to be held at the same time and place, unless changed by the Chief.

Unless otherwise specified, all meetings and activities are open to all men. Attendance is not required at any meeting or activity. All activities must be sponsored by a team or other group of Momentum members.

Confidentiality
---------------

Members are expected to maintain the confidentiality of others. The mailing list is proprietary to Momentum and may not be distributed or used without the permission of the Chiefs.

The Charter may be openly discussed with anyone.

Finances
--------

It is vital that Momentum be financially stable and that its finances are managed openly, conservatively, and legally. The Treasurer is required to publish a written financial report each calendar quarter.

The Chief may not sign checks or otherwise unilaterally authorize transfer of money during his chiefdom, but may approve reimbursement of expenses or payment of obligations by communication with those authorized to sign on the accounts or initiate transfers of funds.

*Momentum is a dba of the Nation of Men, a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of California.*
