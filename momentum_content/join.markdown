Momentum is open to men 18 and over. To become a member, complete the application form and pay the annual dues. Members have access to the Members community social Discourse platform and can attend members-only events. 

Annual dues are $80 for regular members, and $40 for remote members (who live more than 50 miles from the Bay Area). Dues renew every 12 months. Credit card auto-renewal is the default setting, but can be disabled if desired.

**Member application and payment for** [**Regular**](https://momentum4men.memberful.com/checkout?plan=22178) **or** [**Remote**](https://momentum4men.memberful.com/checkout?plan=24440) **members**.

Payment options: Online via credit card or check (manual). Paying online will give you instant access to the Members community social Discourse platform and is the preferred method. If paying by check, you will receive an email giving you access once your payment is received. Manual payment instructions can be obtained by clicking [_**Get in Touch**_](../contact/) from the main menu. Special arrangements are available for men for whom full dues are a hardship.
