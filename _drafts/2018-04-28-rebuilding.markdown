# An inspiring service -- Truly Rebuilding Together

Men, I am truly humbled and inspired by the way this community showed up, and the impact of our collective efforts. 30 men from momentum volunteered their time. Combined with friends, family, and volunteers from Jerry’s meetup group and Rotary, there were nearly 80 volunteers over the four days of the project.

My favorite moment of the weekend was hearing the reactions of the clients and staff returning late on Sunday night. They were really blown away by the way we transformed their space, and so so grateful.

This weekend was also special for me because my dad showed up for 3 days to help. It’s been a very long time since we’ve worked on anything together. I owe it to this community for making this possible.

I’d love to hear what inspired you this weekend. If you don’t normally volunteer, would you do it again? Please post your comments below.

Dave
